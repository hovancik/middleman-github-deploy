# What is jgd ?

If you use some plugins with your Jekyll blog, chances are you can not
have your blog generated by GitHub.

This is where jekyll-github-deploy (a.k.a. jgd) comes in: it will
automatically build your Jekyll blog and push it to your gh-pages
branch.

# Installing

It is assumed that your blog is in the home directory of your repo.

Install it first:

```bash
gem install jgd
```

Run it locally:

```bash
jgd
```

Now your site is deployed to `gh-pages` branch of your repo. Done.

# Production variables

If you need to have different values for your deployed blog, just add a
`_config-deploy.yml` file in your project's root and you're set. Values
re-defined in `_config-deploy.yml` will override those defined in
`_config.yml`.

Typical usage includes changing site `url`, disable disqus or ga in
development...., you name it.

# Deploying with Travis

This is how I configure [my Jekyll blog](https://github.com/yegor256/blog)
to be deployed automatically by [travis-ci](http://www.travis-ci.org):

```yaml
branches:
  only:
    - master
env:
  global:
    - secure: ...
install:
  - bundle
script: jgd -u http://yegor256:$PASSWORD@github.com/yegor256/blog.git
```

The environment variable `$PASSWORD` is set through
`env/global/secure`, as explained
[here](http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/encryption-keys/).

Don't forget to add `gem require 'jgd'` to your `Gemfile`.

You can use SSH key instead. First, you should [encrypt](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/encrypting-files/) it:

```bash
$ travis encrypt-file id_rsa --add
```

Then, use the URI that starts with `git@`:

```yaml
script:
  - jgd -u git@github.com:yegor256/blog.git
```

Read also [this article](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/06/22/jekyll-github-deploy.html).

PS. You can also specify target branch, with is `gh-pages` by default. Use
`--branch` command line option.
